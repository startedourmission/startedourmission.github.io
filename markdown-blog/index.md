I'm Cha Jinwoo, a computer science researcher and artificial intelligence developer from South Korea. As an academy instructor, I focus on computer vision and deep learning research.

My academic journey began at Inha Technical College, followed by research work at Inha University. My primary research focus has been in the field of security surveillance systems, specifically working on object detection algorithms for CCTV applications. I maintain a strong interest in multimodal approaches that bridge natural language processing and computer vision. Since 2023, I have transitioned into education, serving as an instructor at an academy where I teach professional certification courses in Information Processing, programming languages (Python, C/C++), and advanced topics in data analysis, including machine learning and deep learning methodologies.
